# shopping-list
Web app for a simple shopping list

A "progressive web app" that implements a simple shopping list stored locally via localStorage, can be installed to a phone's homescreen (from Chrome on Android at least) to open as a standalone app and works offline.

Uses Material Design Lite for an Android-like look and is written in vanilla JavaScript otherwise.
